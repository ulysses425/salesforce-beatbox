Changelog
=========

16.0 (2009-11-12)
-----------------

* Don't strip newlines when marshalling the values of textarea fields.
  [davisagli]

* Make sure to add a field to fieldsToNull if its Python value is None.
  [rhettg, davisagli]

* Fix issue where numbers of type long weren't converted to a string.
  [spleeman, davisagli]

  [spleeman, davisagli]


16.0b1 (2009-09-08)
-------------------

* Log beatbox calls at the debug level.
  [davisagli]

* Fixed a string exception for compatibility with Python 2.6.
  [davisagli]

* Added support for SOSL searches via the search method.  Thanks to Alex Tokar
  of Web Collective.
  [davisagli]

* Added an optional cache for the sObject type descriptions needed for
  marshalling query results into Python objects. This can avoid an extra
  describeSObjects API call for each query, but means that the information
  could become stale if the type metadata is modified in Salesforce.com.
  The cache is off by default. Turn it on by passing
  cacheTypeDescriptions=True when instantiating a Python client. The cache may
  be reset by calling the flushTypeDescriptionsCache method of the Python
  client.
  [davisagli]

* Support a full SOQL statement as a parameter to the query method of the
  Python client.  The old 3-part method signature (fields, sObjectType,
  conditionalExpression) should continue to work.
  [davisagli]

* In the Python client, support relationship queries and other queries that may
  return multiple types of objects.  Object type descriptions (required for
  marshalling field values into the correct Python type) are cached for the
  duration of the query after the first time they are used.  Thanks to
  Melnychuk Taras of Quintagroup.
  [davisagli]

* In the Python client, queries now return a list-like QueryRecordSet holding
  a sequence of dict-like QueryRecord objects, instead of a dict containing a
  list of dicts.  This allows for more Pythonic access such as results[0].Id
  instead of results['results'][0]['Id'].  The old syntax should still work.
  Thanks to Melnychuk Taras of Quintagroup.
  [davisagli]

* Update to use version 16.0 of the Salesforce.com partner WSDL.
  [davisagli]

  False.
